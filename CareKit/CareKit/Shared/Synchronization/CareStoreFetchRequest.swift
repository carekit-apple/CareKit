/// A property wrapper useful for streaming data from a CareKit store.
///
/// The property wrapper offers a few initializers matching the different entities available in
/// the CareKit store. Each initializer requires a query that is used to locate the desired data.
///
///     @CareStoreFetchRequest(query: OCKTaskQuery())
///     private var tasks
///
/// CareKit stores the fetched results in the `wrappedValue` and will always stay up to date
/// with changes to the store.
///
/// The property wrapper also offers a binding to the query in the case it needs to be modified.
/// Modifying the query  triggers a new fetch request.
///
///     Button("Update Query") {
///         tasks.query = newQuery
///     }
///
/// Define the property wrapper on a `View` that contains the store in its environment.
/// You can inject the store through the environment like this:
///
///     ContentView()
///         .environment(\.careKitStore, store)
///
/// See the `OCKAnyStoreProtocol` and the `OCKStore` for more information about
/// creating a CareKit store.
///
/// You may need to update the query over time. For example, suppose you're using
/// the property wrapper to fetch and display tasks for "today." After midnight passes,
/// the notion of "today" changes and you need to fetch new results. To detect events such
/// as the passage of a day or a change of time zone, observe
/// [significant time change notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1623059-significanttimechangenotificatio).
///
/// ```swift
///     ContentView()
///         .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIApplication.significantTimeChangeNotification)) { _ in
///             tasks.query.dateInterval = Calendar.current.dateInterval(of: .day, for: Date())!
///     }
/// ```
///
/// If you prefer to update the query date at a very specific time interval, see [`TimelineView`](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=timelineview&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safari_group=3).
