/**
 An instance of the `OCKCarePlanStore` class represents a care plan database.
 It stores activities and events.
 
 An activity can be added to, or removed from, a store. 
 Once an activity has been added to a store, only the endDate can be changed by using the  setEndDate:forActivity:completion: method. 
 Update the state of an event after the user has responded to it.
 
 You can query the store in the following ways:
 - Get all the activities in the store.
 - Get all the activities of a given type (intervention or assessment) in the store.
 - Get the activity for a given identifier.
 - Get activities for a given group identifier
 - Get the events of a type (intervention or assessment) for a given date.
 - Get the events for a given activity for a given date.
 - Enumerate all the events for a given activity for a range of dates
 - Enumerate the completion status for a given type (intervention or assessment) for a range of dates.
