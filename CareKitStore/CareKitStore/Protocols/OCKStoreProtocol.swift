/// CareKit can support any store that conforms to this protocol. The `OCKStore` class included in CareKit is a CoreData store that the implements
/// `OCKStoreProtocol` to provide on device storage. Support for other databases such as JSON files, REST API's, websockets, and 3rd part databases
/// can be added by conforming them to `OCKStoreProtocol`.
///
/// `OCKStoreProtocol` requires that a minimum level of functionality be provided, and then provides enhanced functionality via protocol extensions.
/// The methods provided by protocol extensions are naive implementations and are not efficient. Developers may wish to use the customization points
/// on `OCKStoreProtocol` to provide more efficient implementations that take advantage of the underlying database's native features.
///
/// - Remark: All methods defined in this protocol are required to be implemented as batch operations and should function as transactions.
/// If any one operation should fail, the state of the store should be returned to the state it was in before the transaction began. For example,
/// if an attempt to save an array of 10 outcomes fails on the 6th outcome, the first successfully persisted 6 outcomes must be rolled back to restore
/// the store to the state it was in prior to the transaction.
