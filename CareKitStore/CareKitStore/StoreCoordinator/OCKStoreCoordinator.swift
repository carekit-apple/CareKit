/// `OCKStoreCoordinator` is a special kind of pass through store that forwards to a group of other stores.
/// It has different behavior during **read** and **write** operations.
///
/// When objects are **fetched** from an `OCKStoreCoordinator`, the `OCKStoreCoordinator`
/// will transparently query all of the stores it knows about and return the aggregated results.
///
/// When objects are **added**, **updated**, or **deleted**, a `OCKStoreCoordinator` will attempt to find a single store
/// that can accept responsibility for all the objects that need to be written, and direct the work to that store. If the objects do not all
/// belong to a single store, then the write operation will fail. This is to ensure that write operations are transactional.
///
/// - Note: The order in which stores are registered on an `OCKStoreCoordinator` is important. If two or more stores are
///  capable of writing an object, the one that was registered first will be given precedence.
