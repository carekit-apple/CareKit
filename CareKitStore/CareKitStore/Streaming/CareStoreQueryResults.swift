// Note:
//
// This class is a mechanism for wrapping another sequence, allowing us to
// hide the implementation details of the wrapped sequence from the public API.
//
// For example, the standard Concurrency map function yields (notice the type information):
//
// ```
// let stream: AsyncStream<Int> = makeSomeIntStream()
// let transformedStream: AsyncMapSequence<AsyncStream<Int>, Double> = stream.map { Double($0) }
// ```
//
// Notice how the type information exposes the implementation details to the consumer.
// To hide that away, we can wrap the transformed stream:
//
// let finalStream: CareStoreQueryResults<Double> = CareStoreQueryResults(sequence: transformedStream)
// ```

/// A continuous stream of entities that exist in a CareKit store.
///
/// You can't instantiate this stream directly. Instead, use methods like ``OCKReadableTaskStore/tasks(matching:)`` to create
/// one. Similarly named methods exist for streaming other entities in a store.

        // later on when needed.
