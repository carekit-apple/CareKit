import Foundation

/// An object that combines the progress for multiple tasks.
///
/// This type can be useful for displaying progress for multiple tasks using a progress bar. If you have multiple events,
/// start by computing the progress for each event individually:
///
/// ```swift
/// let medication: OCKAnyEvent = getMedicationEvent()
/// let medicationProgress = medication.computeProgress(by: .checkingOutcomeExists)
///
/// let steps: OCKAnyEvent = getStepsEvent()
/// let stepsProgress = steps.computeProgress(by: .summingOutcomeValues)
///
/// let progress = AggregatedCareTaskProgress(combining: [medicationProgress, stepsProgress]
/// ```
///
/// Progress units are weighted equally when combining progress for multiple events. In the example above,
/// suppose each of the two events is 50% completed. The final combined progress becomes 50%. Now suppose one
/// event is 100% completed and the other is 50% completed. The final progress becomes 75%.
///
/// Use this type to create parent progress for a group of subtasks:
///
/// ```swift
/// let medicationDoseA: OCKAnyEvent = getDoseAEvent()
/// let medicationDoseB: OCKAnyEvent = getDoseBEvent()
/// let medicationProgress = AggregatedCareTaskProgress(events: [medicationDoseA, medicationDoseB])
///
/// let steps: OCKAnyEvent = getStepsEvent()
/// let stepsProgress = steps.computeProgress(by: .summingOutcomeValues)
///
/// let progress = AggregatedCareTaskProgress(combining: [medicationProgress, stepsProgress]
/// ```
///
/// Once progress is constructed, it can easily be applied to a
/// [ProgressView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/progressview)
/// in SwiftUI:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some View {
///     ProgressView(value: progress.fractionCompleted)
/// }
/// ```
