Getting Started <a name="gettingstarted"></a>
===============

Requirements
------------

The primary CareKit framework codebase supports iOS and requires Xcode 11.0
or newer.
The CareKit framework has a Base SDK version of 13.0, meaning that apps
using the CareKit framework can run on devices with iOS 13.0 or newer.


Installation
------------

The latest stable version of the CareKit™ framework is version 1.2 and can be cloned with:

```
git clone -b stable --recurse-submodules https://github.com/carekit-apple/carekit.git
```

Or, for the latest changes including early access to CareKit 2.0, use the `master` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/carekit-apple/carekit.git
```

Building
--------

Build the CareKit framework by opening `CareKit.xcodeproj` and running the
`CareKit` framework target. Optionally, run the unit tests too.


Adding the CareKit framework to your App
------------------------------

To get started, drag `CareKit.xcodeproj` from your checkout into
your iOS app project in Xcode.

Then, embed the CareKit framework as a dynamic framework in your app, by adding
it to the Embedded Binaries section of the General pane for your
target as shown in the figure below.

Discovering How CareKit Works
------------------------------

One of the best ways to see how CareKit works is to look at the [OCKSample](../../tree/master/OCKSample/OCKSample) app. 
You can find it in the CareKit sample directory. You will need to add the CareKit framework to the 
sample, as described in the previous section.

Build and run OCKSample. Then take a look at the code and experiment by making a few changes.
